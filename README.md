I am currently a fourth-year student studying Computer Science at **Xavier University - Ateneo de Cagayan**. 

I have **two scholarships** that I earned to support my schooling - those being my **CHED** (Commission on Higher Education) and **XCCA** (Xavier Center for Culture and the Arts) scholarships.

I have been a consistent student leader in relevant organizations and my experience is the following:

- [**Google Developers Student Club Xavier** - Chief Technology Officer](https://www.facebook.com/gdscxavier/photos/pcb.289870642992645/289870356326007/)
- **Xavier Computer Enthusiasts League** - Director of Communicaations and Constituent Insights
- **Crusader Yearbook** - Computer Systems Officer

## Achievements
Probably my proudest achievement throughout my entire college experience was being able to qualify to Google's [2022 Solutions's Challenge Global Top 50 Teams](https://developers.google.com/community/gdsc-solution-challenge/winners) under [Team Bilin](https://www.facebook.com/BilinApp).

Under my leadership, our university also managed to enter the most number of participants from the Philippines.

Ever since my freshman year, I have also been a consistent **dean's lister** in my College.
